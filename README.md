## iconv-browser: another iconv for use in browser

This is based on the package [@sinonjs/text-encoding](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@sinonjs/text-encoding), which is much smaller than iconv-lite. An example project is [Super-preloader](https://github.com/machsix/Super-preloader/commit/7ab496b76a6b68b436fb7979138f0adc243fbac5)
